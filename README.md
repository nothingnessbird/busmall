# busmall

##BusMall
This is an assignment for CodeFellows week 3.
The page is meant to diplay 3 products at a time that a user can click on to vote, and when they have voted 25 times, it will display how many votes each product received.

##Attributions
Brandon and Nick and Jim and Caleb all helped on 8/21 with functions in JavaScript

On day 3, Kinley and Marco pair-programmed to debug and to fix any issues with the bus-mall project. Kinley was the navigator; Marco was the driver.
